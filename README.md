Abhishek Amalaraj IS 542 Project 1 - The Scriptures Mapped ( JavaScript )

From this Project, I observed a lot of new ways to call functions and parameters and certainly my understanding of the language has improved. 
I found it to be very useful as I am researching in on geospatial engineering and an introduction to google apis was very helpful. 
I am excited for Project 2 with repect to the visualization and uses across different platforms.
